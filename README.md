# HillClimbing
A simple yet effective algorithmic solution for certain heuristic search problems. It has been implemented using advanced design concepts such as inheritance or abstract classes. 
 + Includes a simple hill climbing implementation, optimal for search situations where we don't have much information available like exiting the maze
 + Includes a maximum slope hill climbing implementation, which will be more useful in situations with some more available variables to make decissions.
